# Monokai Mod

## About

I started using Monokai in Textmate years ago and have made some subtle color tweaks to it for my own preference.

Recently I switched to Vim and wanted my beloved theme. I just converted it with [Coloration](https://github.com/sickill/coloration) and here we are.

I can't find the original source of the Monokai Textmate theme, but if someone has it, please shoot me a message so I can add a link here.

## Installation

Put monokai-mod.vim file in your ~/.vim/colors/ directory (or install it with Vundle) and add the following line to your ~/.vimrc:

    syntax enable
    colorscheme monokai-mod
